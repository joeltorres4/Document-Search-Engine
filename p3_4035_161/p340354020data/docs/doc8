Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie will team up with computer coders from the 
web giant Google for a Thursday rally at a Bronx public school urging kids 
to pursue studies in computer science.

Heastie will join the Google brainiacs for the so-called CS First Roadshow 
to give a demonstration in coding for about 80 kids in grades 4-8 at the 
Cornerstone Academy Middle School in the Bronx.

The goal, Heastie said, is to ignite kids' passion for studying science, 
technology, engineering and math — better known as STEM.

“Although the demand for individuals trained in STEM fields remains high, 
students often overlook STEM subjects during their education,” the powerful 
Bronx Democrat said. “If we can pique their interest early, the hope is that 
we can inspire them to be the future innovators of technology and pursue a 
field that has the potential for a lifelong career with far reaching impacts.”

Thursday's event is just the latest in Google's ongoing efforts to boost 
STEM in the city schools.

The company is working with the city and the telecom provider Sprint to 
create a program for free wireless internet access for the families of 
city students.

Google also held free coding classes for city kids over the summer and 
participates in a variety of internship programs for city students.

“Kids are exposed to technology at such an early age, but don't necessarily 
get to learn about why computer science should be an important part of their 
lives,” said Google spokesman Jamie Hill. “We want the next generation of 
students to be able to create technology, not just consume it.”
